Contradictory results regarding the effect of proton_pump_inhibitors on platelet reactivity and on clinical outcome in clopidogrel -treated patients have been reported in literature.
Concomitant use of omeprazole and clopidogrel was found to decrease the exposure (AUC) to clopidogrel's active metabolite by 50% and to sharply increase platelet reactivity, as a result of inhibition by omeprazole of CYP2C19, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme.

Pantoprazole has a much weaker effect on clopidogrel 's pharmacokinetics and on platelet reactivity during concomitant use.
The influence of the other proton_pump_inhibitors when used simultaneously with clopidogrel has not yet been investigated in adequately randomized studies.
Regulatory agencies state that the combination of clopidogrel and the CYP2C19 inhibitors omeprazole and esomeprazole should be avoided.

Synergistic interaction between sunitinib and docetaxel is sequence dependent in human non-small lung cancer with EGFR TKIs-resistant mutation.
This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of sunitinib and that of concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib and docetaxel in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to EGFR TKIs.
This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of sunitinib and that of concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib and docetaxel in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to EGFR TKIs.
Sunitinib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in NSCLC cell lines and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, whereas docetaxel arrested at S phase.
Although single or concurrent use of sunitinib and docetaxel has some anti-proliferative effects, the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti-tumor activity.
When cells were exposed to docetaxel followed by sunitinib , synergism was observed.
The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by docetaxel exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to sunitinib .
Sunitinib as a single agent exhibits anti-proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M and K-ras mutations but the sequential administration of docetaxel followed by sunitinib is superior to sunitinib followed by docetaxel and concurrent administration.

The combined use of fluconazole at doses of # mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated.
The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than # mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.
Cisapride : There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered.
A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole # mg once daily and cisapride # mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval.
A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole # mg once daily and cisapride # mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval.
The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.
Astemizole : The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs.
Rifabutin : There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered.
Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.
Tacrolimus : There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered.
Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.
Short-acting_Benzodiazepines : Following oral administration of midazolam , fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.
Short-acting_Benzodiazepines : Following oral administration of midazolam , fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects.
This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.
This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously.
If short-acting_benzodiazepines , which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole , consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.

Diuretics : Patients on diuretics , and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of ACEON   Tablets therapy.
Diuretics : Patients on diuretics , and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of ACEON   Tablets therapy.
The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril .
If diuretics cannot be interrupted, close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of ACEON   Tablets, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour.
The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics .
The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics , however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition.
